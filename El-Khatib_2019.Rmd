#### <i> Moral Credit and the 2016 Election: Voting for the Female Candidate to be Sexist </i>
#### In 2016 Americans had the opportunity to either vote for the first major female presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, or one of the most sexually and racially controversial candidates in modern American history, Donald Trump. Due to Trump's reprehensible rhetoric, it was often publicly argued that supporting Clinton was the more morally admirable decision.  Though, to date, there is little research which has comprehensively examined the psychological effects of supporting these two candidates.  Previous literature regarding the 2008 election of Barack Obama informs us that supporting a Black presidential candidate can make individuals feel “morally credentialed” to favor providing resources to White people at the behest of Black people (Effron et al., 2009).  Do these findings replicate when supporting female candidates?  Will feelings of moral credit influence political attitudes and policy preferences on topics related to gender?  This work answers these questions through a series of experimental designs comparable with the existing political psychology literature on morality.  Findings from this work are part of a greater project to explore the ways that individuals rationalize seemingly contradictory political preferences.
