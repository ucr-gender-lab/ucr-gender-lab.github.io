### <u> Political Ambition Group </u>
#### <i> Women and Political Ambition: Running for Us or Running for Me? </i>
#### The year 2018 has been dubbed the year of the woman because of the increased number of women not only running for office, but also winning. For the first time in U.S. history, over 100 women are in the U.S. House, with 32 being newly elected. The freshmen class is also among the most diverse in U.S. history. While the national level has received the lion’s share of attention in the media, similar trends have been happening at the state and local level.  What helps to account for this dramatic increase?

### <u> Gender Stereotypes Group </u>
#### <i> Counterstereotypic Gender Strategies and Candidate Trait and Issue Evaluations </i>
#### 2018 is turning out to be another year of the woman, with record numbers of women running for political office. It is therefore imperative to understand some of the challenges and opportunities women face on the campaign trail. The literature to date suggests that women face a fundamental challenge in running for office in that voters do not associate female candidates with the qualities most valued in political leaders including both experience and knowledge. Recent experimental work by Bauer (2017) demonstrates that there are benefits to women endorsing masculine trait competencies, and that this does not necessarily result in losing traditional feminine strengths (e.g., warmth and likability), in particular among co-partisan voters. The present study seeks to replicate and extend the work by Bauer (2017) in examining whether it is beneficial for women to endorse more masculine trait competencies, but we also consider whether counterstereotypic gender strategies also improve competence evaluations across different issue domains, or whether it varies across issues. To test these relationships, we are fielding an experimental study with Qualtrics panelists in the fall of 2018.

### <u> Emotional Engagement Group </u>
#### <i> Emotional Engagement in the Year of the Woman </i>
#### Women have become more deeply engaged in politics since the 2016 election. The historic nature of that election allows it to serve as an important case study in understanding how the political environment can shape emotional reactions and engagement for women. We argue that gendered features of the political environment from that election and its aftermath influenced emotional reactions to politics in distinct ways and more strongly for Democratic women, and in turn led to increased engagement. We use experimental designs in which participants were randomly assigned vignettes about Trump’s treatment of women, Clinton’s historic run for office, the Women’s Marches, or the #MeToo movement. Reading about Trump’s treatment of women led to higher anger, especially among Democratic women, while reading about Clinton’s run for office increased enthusiasm among highly educated women. These elevated emotions increased intended future engagement.
