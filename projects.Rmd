### <u> Political Ambition Group </u>
#### <i> Women and Political Ambition: Running for Us or Running for Me? </i>
#### The year 2018 has been dubbed the year of the woman because of the increased number of women not only running for office, but also winning. For the first time in U.S. history, over 100 women are in the U.S. House, with 32 being newly elected. The freshmen class is also among the most diverse in U.S. history. While the national level has received the lion’s share of attention in the media, similar trends have been happening at the state and local level.  What helps to account for this dramatic increase?

### <u> Audit Study Group </u>
#### <i> The Muted Effect of #MeToo on Elite’s Civic Engagement Recruitment </i>
#### <i> A replication and extension of Kalla, Rosenbluth, and Teele (2018) </i>
#### Activists play a crucial role in local party organizations and, both directly and indirectly, shape national politics (Masket 2009). In addition, activists comprise a substantial portion of candidates (Moncrief, Squire, and Jewell 2001). Using a field experiment with local politicians, combined with text analysis, this exploratory study examines gender differences in activism. This allows us to test whether gender segregation in activism is due to activists’ or agenda setters’ preferences. Do women focus on “women’s” issues because they want to, or because that is what others nudge them to do?

### <u> Gender Stereotypes Group </u>
#### <i> Counterstereotypic Gender Strategies and Candidate Trait and Issue Evaluations </i>
#### 2018 is turning out to be another year of the woman, with record numbers of women running for political office. It is therefore imperative to understand some of the challenges and opportunities women face on the campaign trail. The literature to date suggests that women face a fundamental challenge in running for office in that voters do not associate female candidates with the qualities most valued in political leaders including both experience and knowledge. Recent experimental work by Bauer (2017) demonstrates that there are benefits to women endorsing masculine trait competencies, and that this does not necessarily result in losing traditional feminine strengths (e.g., warmth and likability), in particular among co-partisan voters. The present study seeks to replicate and extend the work by Bauer (2017) in examining whether it is beneficial for women to endorse more masculine trait competencies, but we also consider whether counterstereotypic gender strategies also improve competence evaluations across different issue domains, or whether it varies across issues. To test these relationships, we are fielding an experimental study with Qualtrics panelists in the fall of 2018.

### <u> Moral Credit & Debt Group </u>
#### <i> Moral Credit and the 2016 Election: Voting for the Female Candidate to be Sexist </i>
#### In 2016 Americans had the opportunity to either vote for the first major female presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, or one of the most sexually and racially controversial candidates in modern American history, Donald Trump. Due to Trump's reprehensible rhetoric, it was often publicly argued that supporting Clinton was the more morally admirable decision.  Though, to date, there is little research which has comprehensively examined the psychological effects of supporting these two candidates.  Previous literature regarding the 2008 election of Barack Obama informs us that supporting a Black presidential candidate can make individuals feel “morally credentialed” to favor providing resources to White people at the behest of Black people (Effron et al., 2009).  Do these findings replicate when supporting female candidates?  Will feelings of moral credit influence political attitudes and policy preferences on topics related to gender?  This work answers these questions through a series of experimental designs comparable with the existing political psychology literature on morality.  Findings from this work are part of a greater project to explore the ways that individuals rationalize seemingly contradictory political preferences.
